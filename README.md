# what I've learned today?

- I've learned a new feature which is the **SSH** 
- I've learned how to write in README file *I've never used it before*
- also, how to open directory from terminal 
----
## what I get from the read:
- as developer I need to try to understand all features that I'm working with
- the code should be as simple as possible
- always check the periority of the change and the value that change will add to code before make it happen
- always understand the problem and the case before write the code 
- I always shous try to reduce the code if it's possible
- test the code after each stage will make solving and finding the errors faster
- documintation and commiting is so important and shoud be clear
- reduce the use of libraries as much as possible 
- always try to solve the bug before asking about it
